        <p>Setting up your project to work with hiredisx requires CMake, Make and Hiredis.</p>

        <p>
          Assuming that you have CMake and Make installed you can run the following script to
          install both hiredis and hiredisx all in one go:
        </p>

        <ngx-gist [gistId]="'ChrisCates/32e04e3d89cb044efb7de8f5dc255c2f'" class="gist-p1-1"></ngx-gist>

        <p>
          Once hiredis and hiredisx are installed, you need to configure your CMakeLists.txt file to support
          both libraries. The following configuration for CMake will work for most unix platforms:

        <p>
          You should now be able to include the hiredisx.hpp header file into your project.

        <p class="command-title">hiredisx::set</p>
        <p class="command">bool hiredisx::set(std::string key, std::string value)</p>
        <p>
          hiredisx::set returns a boolean after setting a key. If true, this means that
          the key was successfully set. If false, this means the key was not set. The key
          that was set is now retrievable via the key string specified.

        <p class="command">std::string hiredisx::get(std::string key)</p>
        <p>
          hiredisx::get returns the string value of a specified key. If the key has not been set
          it will simply just return an empty string. If there is an error connecting with the database.
          The string value will contain details of why it failed.

        <p class="command">bool hiredisx::del(std::string key)</p>
        <p>
          hiredisx::del deletes a specified key. It will return true if the key has been successfully
          deleted. It will return false if there was an error connecting with the database.
        </p>

        <p class="command-title">hiredisx::push</p>
        <p class="command">bool hiredisx::push(std::string key, std::string value, std::string prefix = "L")</p>
        <p>
          hiredisx::push appends a value to a list. If the list does not exist, it will create a new one.
          Note that it works similar to the set command, however, it includes a prefix that is default to "L".
          The prefix can be either "L" or "R". If left, it will prepend to the beginning of the list. If "R"
          it will append it to the end of the list.
        </p>
        <p class="command-title">Example</p>

        <p>
          hiredisx::list retrieves a vector of the list. The start integer specifies where to start in the list.
          The end integer specifies where to stop. If the end integer is set to -1. It will retrieve til the end of
          the list. Similar to the push command. The prefix "L" means to iterate forward from start to finish.
          While "R" means to iterate backwards from finish to the starting point.
